# citymarkers
Unity AR App that allows users to scan iconic sites around Berlin and contextualize the transformation the city has undergone in the last decades. This app is a prototype presented to the Humboldt Forum in Berlin.

The app uses the Unity library ARKit to create Augmented Reality Experiences.

When the user opens the app, he is prompted with a map that shows what "sites" are around him. The user can press a button that will show a specific site's picture. When the user reaches the site, they can scan the building with their phone. The app will then overlay text and images that will explain what the building used to look like and what its uses were.
